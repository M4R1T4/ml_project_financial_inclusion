# Financial Inclusion in Africa

![](/plots_and_pictures/africa_symbol_big.png)

In the years 2016-2018, survey was conducted in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda to find out how many people in these countries have a bank account (or not) and other factors that could have an influence.


* 23,500 people were interviewed <br/>
* 14% of the people use a bank account
* 86% have no access to a bank account


## The Countries

The survey was conducted in 4 East African countries. Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda.

Although these 4 are neighbouring countries, they differ greatly in terms of their populations, landscapes, historical conflicts and the resulting economic structures.   

The two largest countries are Tanzania and Kenya. Both border the Indian Ocean to the east. On the western side, both, together with Uganda, border Lake Victoria, the largest freshwater lake in Africa. Rwanda, on the other hand, is the smallest country of the four. It also differs from the others in that it is very hilly and forms the border between the Nile and Congo rivers. 
We also expect to see differences in the data between the individual countries. 


## Comparison between Population and Number of respondents

We compared the number of respondents in the respective countries with the population of these countries at the time of the survey. The aim was to see whether the ratio is the same.

On the left-hand side of the chart, the bars show the number of people in the countries during the survey period. The bars on the right show the number of people surveyed in the respective country. As can be seen, the ratio of people interviewed in the different countries does not reflect the ratio of the population between the countries. For example, most people were interviewed in Rwanda, although Rwanda has by far the smallest population of the four countries. 

## Bank Accounts

Pie chart shows the percentage of those who have a bank account in green and those who donâ€™t have a account in orange
the rate is very different in the various countries
A quarter of respondents in Kenya have a bank account
the proportion of people with bank access is much smaller in other countries (11 % in Rwanda, 9% in Uganda and Tanzania)

## Gender

Who is more likely to have a bank account? Men or Woman?

![gender](/plots_and_pictures/Gender.png)


The majority of respondents are women (around 60%)
But only 11 % of female interviewees have a bank account. 
Almost every fifth man (19%) has a bank account

## Cell Phone Access

Respondents were asked whether or not they had access to a cell phone. The answers resulted in different groups with regard to bank account and mobile phone access.

![Cell_Phone_vs_Bank_account](/plots_and_pictures/CellPhone_vs_BankAccount.png)

The Matrix shows 4 groups:

* People who have both: a bank account and access to a cell phone  (13.6%)
* People who have a bank account but no access to a cell phone (0.4%)
* People who have neither a bank account nor access to a cell phone (25.4%)
* People who do not have a bank account but do have access to a cell phone (60.6%)  

The last group is the most interesting. It is also the largest. In this group, the respondents have a mobile phone but no bank account. They may already be using mobile payment options anyway. This group would be the ideal target group for banks to reach via straightforward mobile app access. 

## Education Level

Respondents were asked about their highest educational qualification. We have analysed this information in different ways. 

### Education Level per Country

As we are interested in seeing whether there are differences between the educational qualifications in the individual countries, we have broken these down by country.   
Because the number of people surveyed varied from country to country, we have calculated the rate of educational level in relation to the whole country. The bars therefore show the proportion of respondents from a country who declared the respective level of education.

Beschreibung was ich sehe

### Dependence between Education level and Bank Account

Da wir nur knapp 20% Bank accounts haben ist es sinnvoll die Anteile an Bank accounts anzuschauen um den Einfluss von Education Level zu sehen.

Wenn jemand special Education hat, dann ist ist die Chance hoch, einen Bank account zu haben, aber es sind halt nicht viele. Aufpassen, das Argument geht auch anders herum, bei Other/No answer Job Type
